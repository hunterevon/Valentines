nothing special... funny website to ask someone to be your valentines

## React frontend template (Vite)

This repository now includes a minimal Vite + React scaffold to build a small front-end website.

What's included

- `package.json` - scripts to run the dev server, build, and preview
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration with the React plugin
- `public/index.html` - app HTML entry
- `src/main.jsx` - React entry
- `src/App.jsx` - top-level app component
- `src/components/Heart.jsx` - small interactive component (example)
- `src/styles.css` - basic styles

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes

- This is a minimal front-end scaffold. You can replace the example `Heart` component with your own interactive UI.
- If you'd prefer Create React App, Next.js, or another starter, tell me which and I can re-scaffold accordingly.
